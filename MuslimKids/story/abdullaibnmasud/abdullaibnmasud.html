            <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>  Abdullah Ibn Masood May Allah's blessings be upon him was of the tribe of Banu Huzail and was also the sworn ally of Banu Zahra. When he was still a youth, not yet past the age of puberty, he used to roam the mountain trails of Makkah far away from people, tending the flocks of a Quraish chieftain, Uqbah Ibn Muayt. People called him ‘Ibn Umm Abd’, the son of the mother of a slave. His real name was Abdullah and his fathers name was Masood.
  The youth had heard the news of the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him whom had appeared among his people but he did not attach any importance to it both because of his age and because he was usually far away from Makkan society. It was his habit to leave with the flock of Uqbah early in the morning and not return until nightfall.

  One day while tending the flocks, Abdullah May Allah's blessings be upon him saw two men, middle-aged and of dignified bearing, coming towards him from a distance. They were obviously very thirsty and tired. They came up to him, greeted him and said, ‘Young man, milk one of these sheep for us that we may quench our thirst and recover our strength.’
  ‘I cannot,’ replied the young man. ‘The sheep are not mine. I am only responsible for looking after them.’
  The two men did not argue with him. In fact, despite their thirst, they were extremely pleased at his honest reply. The two men were the blessed Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him himself and his companion, Abu Bakr SiddiqMay Allah's blessings be upon him. They had gone out on that day to the mountains of Makkah to escape the violent persecution of the Quraish.
  The young man in turn was impressed with the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him and his companion and soon became quite attached to them </p>

        <h2>Acceptance Of Islam</h2>
<p>It was not long before Abdullah Ibn MasoodMay Allah's blessings be upon him became a Muslim and offered to be in the service of the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him. The Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him agreed and from that day, the fortunate Abdullah Ibn MasoodMay Allah's blessings be upon him gave up tending sheep in exchange for looking after the needs of the blessed Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him. He was the sixth man to accept Islam. Abdullah Ibn MasoodMay Allah's blessings be upon him remained closely attached to the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him. He would attend to his needs both inside and outside the house. He would accompany him on journeys and expeditions. He would wake him when he slept. He would shield him when he washed. He would carry his staff and his Siwak (toothbrush) and attend to his other personal needs. It was for these reasons that the Sahabah May Allah's blessings be upon him took to calling him Saheb-e-Siwak (bearer of the siwak), Saheb-e-Nalaen (bearer of the slippers), Saheb-e-Mutahara (bearer of the water) and also Saheb-e-Wisadah (bearer of the bedroll).
</p>

<h2>The Prophet's Appreciation</h2>
<p>Abdullah Ibn MasoodMay Allah's blessings be upon him received a unique training in the household of the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him. He was under the guidance of the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him, he adopted his manner and followed his every trait until it was said of him, ‘He was the closest to the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him in character.’ Abdullah was often mistaken as one of the Blessed Household. Abu Musa AshariMay Allah's blessings be upon him says, ‘When we came from Yemen, we thought for some time that AbdullahMay Allah's blessings be upon him was a member of the Blessed Household, because AbdullahMay Allah's blessings be upon him and his mother were constantly coming and going in the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him  presence. Furthermore, the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him  once said to AbdullahMay Allah's blessings be upon him, “O AbdullahMay Allah's blessings be upon him, you do not need permission to enter my house. You are always welcome.”
</p>

<h2>Abdullah's Death</h2>
<p>Abdullah Ibn MasoodMay Allah's blessings be upon him lived to the time of Caliph UthmanMay Allah's blessings be upon him. It was during this era that he retired from his post and returned to Madinah. When he was sick and on his death-bed, UthmanMay Allah's blessings be upon him came to visit him and said, ‘What is your ailment?’ ‘My sins.’ ‘And what do you desire?’ ‘The mercy of my Lord.’ ‘Shall I not give you your stipend which you have refused to take for years now?’ ‘I have no need of it.’ ‘Let it be for your daughters after you.’ ‘Do you fear poverty for my children? I have commanded them to read Surah al-Waqiah every night for I have heard the Prophet May Allah send peace and blessings upon him  saying, “Whoever reads Al-Waqiah every night shall not be afflicted by poverty ever.” </p>
