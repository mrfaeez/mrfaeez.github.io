            <h3>Emigration of our Prophet from Makkah to Madinah</h3>
            <p>The Prophet Muhammad was neither fatalistic nor reckless. His trust in God was absolute, but that had never caused him to drift with the tide of events. Revelation had reminded him that he must never forget to say “in sha Allah” (if God so wills) when he planned to act, and that the memory of God must be associated with humility (especially in regard to his own powers as a human being).</p>
            <p>Thus, Muhammad had been planning an emigration to Medina ( hijrah ) for almost two years, and nothing had been left to chance. Only after making intelligent and thorough use of his human powers had he trusted himself to the divine will, thereby clarifying for us the meaning of at-tawakkul ‘ala Allah (reliance on God, trusting oneself to God): responsibly exercising all the qualities (intellectual, spiritual, psychological, sentimental, etc.) each one of us has been granted and humbly remembering that beyond what is humanly possible, God alone makes things happen.</p>

        <h3>With Abu Bakr</h3>
      <p>Muhammad and Abu Bakr decided to leave Mecca during the night and head toward Yemen to avoid attracting attention. Abu Bakr provided Muhammad with a camel named Qaswa; the Prophet insisted on paying for it, since he wished this emigration to belong to him alone, and he wanted to be debtless when he departed for Yathrib. Similarly, he would refuse the gift of a patch of land that two orphans wanted to make him when he arrived in the city that was henceforth to be known variously as al-Madinah (Medina, meaning “the city”), Madinah arRasul (the city of the Messenger), or al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (the enlightened city).

Having headed south, they went into hiding for a few days in the Thawr cave ( ghar Thawr ). Abu Bakr’s son, Abdullah, was to gather intelligence about the Quraysh’s intentions and bring it to his father and Muhammad. As for Abu Bakr’s daughters, Asma and Aishah, they would prepare food and secretly carry it to the cave at night. Thus Abu Bakr mobilized all his children, the girls as well as the boy, to protect his and the Prophet’s escape, despite the serious danger the situation posed for his daughters in particular. He constantly showed such an equitable attitude in his dealings with his sons and daughters, in the light of the Prophet’s teachings.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding all those arrangements, a group of Quraysh men, suspecting a trick, went south to look for the Prophet. They arrived in front of the cave and prepared to enter. From where he stood, Abu Bakr could see them, and in alarm he told the Prophet that should the men happen to look down they could not fail to see the two of them. Muhammad reassured him and whispered, “Have no fear, for God is with us.”2 Then he added, “What do you think of two [people] whose third is God?”3 Those words soothed Abu Bakr. In the front of the cave, the group noticed that a spiderweb covered the entrance and also that a dove had nested there: it seemed obvious that the fugitives could not be hiding in the cave, and they decided to look for them somewhere else.

Once again, in spite of their carefully planned strategy, the Prophet and his Companion were going through the trial of vulnerability. Their lives had been preserved by nothing but that fragile spiderweb; trust in God ( at-tawakkul ‘ala Allah ), of which the Prophet reminded Abu Bakr at that particular moment, thus took on its full meaning and strength. God alone had the power to save His Messenger. When Muhammad emigrated, he took care to owe nothing to anyone (he refused gifts, settled his debts, and gave back the deposits he held), but he also knew that he owed everything to the One, that his indebtedness and obligation to Him were infinite. Hijrah is primarily this essential teaching at the heart of the Prophet’s experience: a trust in God that entails, without arrogance, absolute independence from people, as well as the humble recognition of absolute dependence upon God.</p>
<p>Abu Bakr had enlisted the services of a non-Muslim Bedouin, Abdullah ibn Urayqat, to guide them to Yathrib by an inconspicuous, unfamiliar route. At the time appointed for departure, ibn Urayqat came to meet them at the cave with the camels, and they headed west, then south, before eventually going north toward Yathrib. It was a very perilous journey, and were the Quraysh to catch up with the three travelers, they were sure to kill them so as to put an end to Muhammad’s subversive activities. The Prophet and his Companion had entrusted themselves to God, yet they had not hesitated to enlist the help of a Bedouin who, although he shared their enemies’ polytheistic beliefs, was well known to them for his trustworthiness (he was proudly true to his word) and his abilities as a guide (he knew better than anyone else the steep, out-of-the way paths they took). Again, such an attitude is present throughout the Prophet’s life: the women and men he surrounded himself with might not share his faith, but they were known to him for their moral qualities and/or their human abilities. Muhammad, like those who came after him, would not hesitate to rely on them.</p>
